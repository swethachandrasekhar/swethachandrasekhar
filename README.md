# Hi thereðŸ‘‹ I'm [Swetha](www.swethacodes.com)! (she/her)

Iâ€™m a dynamic, detail-oriented and collaborative front-end web developer with an excellent track record of building and leading teams to success. 
I love writing clean, easy to understand code and aim to build socially responsible apps that put user experience and accessibility to the forefront. I'm endlessly curious and nothing satisfies me like an elegant solution to a problem.

Iâ€™m excited to continue refining my skills with the right company where I can grow and build great things with passionate people.

When I'm not coding, I'm planning my next adventure travel, playing online chess or perfecting my Masala Chai recipe. 

## My Technical Toolkit:

HTML5 | JavaScript ES6 | CSS3 | REACT | Sass | jQuery | REST APIs | Firebase | Python | 
Git/Github | Accessibility |  Responsive Design | PSD Conversion | Software Testing | Selenium IDE 
 
### ðŸ’» I'm currently: 
- Improving my React skills
- learning React Hooks
- learning Python
 
### :books: In 2021 I want to learn: 
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in working together or just want to chat about The Queen's Gambit!
